# Frank Engineering Interview

We're so glad you're here. This interview is designed for you to show us what you can do. The only time constraint is what your schedule

## The task

We have set up an HTTP server in the `/server` directory. It exposes a single paginated endpoint. Your task is to right a client for this endpoint that paginates through all data on all pages, and does some data processing. Your client can be in any language. **The purpose of the clinet is to find the comment author with the most net upvotes (upvotes minus downvotes)**. You can output this to `stdout`, put it on a webpage, or display it in any other way you see fit.

If you want to add a little spiciness to this exercise, you can optionally set the `FLAKY` environment variable to 1 on the server, and it will fail requests every so often. In this case, you would write your client to retry failed requests.

## Example API request

```
## GET /posts?page=0

{
  hasNext: true,
  posts: [
    { ...
      comments: [
        {
          ...
          replies: [
            {
              ...
              replies: [...]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    { ... },
    { ... },
    { ... },
    { ... },
    ...
  ]
}
